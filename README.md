# Saidit

Saidit is a clone of the basic features of [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com).

## Key Features:
1. Recursive rendering of child comments by mapping comment views in a hash to their parent node.
2. Generously segmented views keep code DRY allowing login to share boilerplate form data and comments to be recursively rendered within parent.
3. Posts model adds a proc to Rails has_many relationship to exclusivly select top-level comments.
